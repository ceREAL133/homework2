                Mr. Mercedes is an American crime drama television series based on the Bill Hodges novel trilogy by
                Stephen King, which consists of Mr. Mercedes, Finders Keepers, and End of Watch. The series premiered on
                Audience on August 9, 2017. It was developed by David E. Kelley and stars Brendan Gleeson and Harry
                Treadaway. In November 2018, it was announced that Audience had renewed the series for a ten-episode
                third season, which premiered on September 10, 2019. In May 2020, Audience was discontinued, with no
                indication of whether the show had been officially canceled or that it would return for a fourth season.
                Its existing three seasons were later picked up in September 2020 by streaming service Peacock. Retired
                detective Bill Hodges is still haunted by the unsolved case of "Mr. Mercedes", who claimed sixteen lives
                when he drove a stolen Mercedes through a line of job-seekers at a local job fair. Meanwhile, brilliant
                young psychopath Brady Hartsfield emerges to focus his attention on Hodges. What begins as an online
                cat-and-mouse game soon has deadly real-life consequences as an increasingly desperate Hartsfield
                becomes bent on leaving his mark on the world.

                Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a 2007 fantasy film directed by David Yates and distributed
                by Warner Bros. Pictures.[6] It is based on J. K. Rowling's 2003 novel of the same name. The fifth
                instalment in the Harry Potter film series, it was written by Michael Goldenberg (making this the only
                film in the series not to be scripted by Steve Kloves) and produced by David Heyman and David Barron.
                The story follows Harry Potter's fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as the
                Ministry of Magic is in denial of Lord Voldemort's return. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry
                Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.
                It is the sequel to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and is followed by Harry Potter and the
                Half-Blood Prince. Live-action filming took place in England and Scotland for exterior locations and
                Leavesden Film Studios in Watford for interior locations from February to November 2006, with a
                one-month break in June. Post-production on the film continued for several months afterwards to add in
                visual effects. The film's budget was reportedly between £75 and 100 million ($150–200 million).[4][5]
                Warner Bros. released the film in the United Kingdom on 12 July 2007 and in North America on 11 July,
                both in conventional and IMAX theatres; it is the first Potter film to be released in IMAX 3D.

            <p class="film-text">
                The Second World War has recently ended in Europe, and the people of the United Kingdom are awaiting the
                results of the 1945 general election. During this time, Winston Churchill goes to France for a holiday
                with his wife Clemmie. Through a series of flashbacks, Churchill recalls some of his most glorious
                moments during the war, and the effect it had on their marriage.
                Into the Storm continues on from The Gathering Storm. It is set against the backdrop of World War II,
                and looks at how Churchill's success as a great wartime leader ultimately undermined his political
                career and threatened his marriage to "Clemmie" - Clementine Hozier.The film proper begins shortly after
                the Second World War commences in September 1939, as Prime Minister Chamberlain calls Churchill and
                Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax, to a private meeting. Chamberlain informs Halifax and Churchill that
                he knows he will be condemned by the British public for failing to recognize Hitler as a threat in time,
                and therefore intends to resign from office. Asked if he would be willing to hold the office of Minister
                for War under Lord Halifax as the new Prime Minister, Churchill remains silent until Halifax reluctantly
                speaks up, indicating Churchill would be the better choice as Prime Minister. Churchill then intones,
                "Yes. I think so, too."
